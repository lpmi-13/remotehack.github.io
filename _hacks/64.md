This officially marks the most writeups I've been behind on, so it's nice to celebrate that in these docs that probably nobody reads. Anyway, this was a nice mid-Summer hack, and there was actual hacking, so I declare it a success!

## Things people did

- **Jacob** was around for a spot of speedrunning learning Java and concurrency for a pair-programming assessment in a job application.

- **Ben** took over Ryan's discord and typed as him about how they hacked some stuff together: https://github.com/remotehack/cycloops

- **Ryan** tempered Ben's bravado with his cool and calm architecting experience. He definitely PM'ed in the feature request to store messages as lat/lng/time...and he also perhaps advocated for the JAM stack, since that's old skool and hipsterish, but without any further evidence, it's just to hard to say...

- **Max** confirmed that the hack of the two hack bros worked.

- **Panda** was unable to attend, but rooted on the hackers.

- **Adam** snuck in a super late-in-the, setting up some terraform to run a headless veilid node on CIVO, which _LOOKED_ like it gave $250 in cloud credits, but that's apparently only valid for 1 month which is total crap, and they should do better.

- **Hugh** couldn't make it, but did explain what he _would_ have done, so I award him half-points.
